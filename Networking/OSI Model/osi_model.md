## OSI 
**Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model**: Is a reference model from the International Organization for Standardization, that provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection. There are 7 different abstraction Layers

**Physical**: Defines the physical means of transmitting raw binary data over a medium like cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals
- Example: 
    - Cables
    - Connectors(RJ45)
    - Signals(voltage levels)

**Data Link**: Provides node-to-node transfer and error/detection
- Example: 
    - Ethernet
    - Wi-Fi

**Network**: Handles routing, addressing, and delivering packets across multiple networks
- Example: 
    - IP(internet protocol)
    - Routers

**Transport**: Ensures reliable data transfer between hosts
- Example: 
    - TCP
    - UDP

**Session**: Manages sessions between applications, ensuring that data is properly synchronized and managed 
- Example: 
    - NetBIOS
    - RPC

**Presentation**: Translates, encrpts, and compresses data to ensure it's in the correct format for the application layer 
- Example: 
    - JPEG
    - SSL/TLS

**Application**: Provides network services directly to applications and end users
- Example: 
    - HTTP
    - FTP
