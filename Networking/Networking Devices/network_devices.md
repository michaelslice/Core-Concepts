## Network Devices

1. **Router**: Is a computer and networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, including internetworks such as the global internet.
    - OSI Layer: Network layer (Layer 3)
    - A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks
    - **Function**: Directs data packets across different IP networks using IP addressing.

2. **Switch**: Is a networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device
    - OSI Layer: Data Link layer (Layer 2).
    - **Function**: Connects devices in the same network and forwards data intelligently based on MAC addresses.

3. **Hub**: A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices in a single network segment
    - A hub recieves data packets(Frames) from a connected device and broadcasts the packets to all other devices in the network
    - OSI Layer: Physical layer (Layer 1).
    - **Function**: Broadcasts data received from one device to all other connected devices.

4. **Bridge**: A bridge is a network device that connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments them to act as a single network
    - Bridges use MAC(Media Access Control) addresses to forward data only to the correct segment
    - OSI Layer: Data Link layer (Layer 2).
    - **Function**: Filters and forwards traffic between segments of a network, using MAC addresses.

5. **Gateway**: A gateway is a networking device that acts as a "gate" between two networks with different protocols
    - Translates data formats, protocols, or languages so that devices from different networks can communicate
    - OSI Layer: Operates across all layers, primarily Application layer (Layer 7).
    - **Function**: Translates data formats or protocols to enable communication between different types of networks.

6. **Modem**: A modem (short for modular-demodulator) is a device that converts digital data from a computer into an analog signal for transmission over telephone lines(modulation) and converts incoming analog signals back into digital data (demodulation)
    - OSI Layer: Physical layer (Layer 1).
    - **Function**: Converts digital data to analog signals (modulation) and analog signals back to digital (demodulation).
