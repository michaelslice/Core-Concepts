## Stack
- **Use**: Stores function call information, including local variables, return addresses, and control flow
- **Management**: Managed automatically by the system in LIFO manner
- **Scope**: Memory is allocated and deallocated as functions are called and return 
- **Speed**: Fast because of its LIFO nature
- **Category**: Part of runtime memory or program stack in execution
## Heap
- **Use**: Used for dynamic memory allocation where variables persist beyond function calls or need manual management
- **Management**: Managed explicitly by the programmer
- **Scope**: Can be global or long-lived depending on how memory is allocated and freed 
- **Speed**: Slower due to manual management and potential fragmentation
- **Category**: Part of dynamic memory or global memory management
