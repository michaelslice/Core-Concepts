# Gates
**Gate**: Refers to a logic gate, a fundamental building block of digital circuits. Logic gates perform basic logical operators(AND, OR, NOT) on binary inputs(0 or 1) to produce a single binary output. These gates are implemented using electronics switches. typically transitors within computer hardwares

## Types of Logic Gates

- **AND Gate**: Outputs 1 only when all inputs are 1.
- **OR Gate**: Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.
- **NOT Gate (Inverter)**: Outputs the opposite of the input (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
- **NAND Gate**: Outputs 0 only when all inputs are 1 (NOT + AND).
- **NOR Gate**: Outputs 1 only when all inputs are 0 (NOT + OR).
- **XOR Gate(Exclusive OR)**: Outputs 1 when the number of 1s in the inputs is odd.
- **XNOR Gate**: (Exclusive NOR): Outputs 1 when the inputs are equal.

## Role in Computers
Logic gates are combined to form:

- **Arithmetic and Logical Units (ALU)**: Perform calculations and logical operations.
- **Memory Units**: Store data (using flip-flops, which are made from gates).
- **Control Circuits**: Determine how data flows through a computer.

### Boolean Algebra Connection
Logic gates are the physical implementation of Boolean algebra, where binary variables are manipulated using logical operations.
