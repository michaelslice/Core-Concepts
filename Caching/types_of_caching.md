# Types of Caching
Caching can be implemented in various ways, depending on the specific use case and the type of data being cached. Here are some of the most common types of caching:
## 1. In-memory caching
In-memory caching stores data in the main memory of the computer, which is faster to access than disk storage. In-memory caching is useful for frequently accessed data that can fit into the available memory. This type of caching is commonly used for caching API responses, session data, and web page fragments
