# Introduction to Caching

## What is Caching?
**Caching** is a high-speed storage layer that sits between an application and the original source of data, such as a database, file system, or remote web service. 

### How Caching Works:
1. **Request Check**: When the application requests data, it first checks the cache.
2. **Cache Hit**: If the data is found in the cache, it is returned directly to the application.
3. **Cache Miss**: If the data is not in the cache:
   - It is retrieved from the original source.
   - Stored in the cache for future use.
   - Returned to the application.

### Benefits of Caching:
- Reduces the need to fetch data from the original source.
- Speeds up data processing.
- Lowers latency in applications.

### Common Use Cases:
- Web pages
- Database queries
- API responses
- Images and videos

## Types of Caching
1. **In-Memory Caching**:
   - Stores data in the computer's main memory (RAM).
   - Extremely fast but limited by memory size.
   - Example: Redis, Memcached.

2. **Disk Caching**:
   - Stores data on the hard disk.
   - Slower than in-memory but faster than fetching data from a remote source.

3. **Database Caching**:
   - Stores frequently accessed data within the database itself.
   - Reduces the need to access external storage or perform expensive queries.

4. **CDN (Content Delivery Network) Caching**:
   - Distributes data across a network of servers worldwide.
   - Reduces latency by serving data from geographically closer servers.

## Key Terminology and Concepts

1. **Cache**:
   - A temporary storage location for data or computation results, designed for fast access and retrieval.

2. **Cache Hit**:
   - Occurs when a requested data item is found in the cache.

3. **Cache Miss**:
   - Happens when a requested data item is not found in the cache and must be retrieved from the original source.

4. **Cache Eviction**:
   - The process of removing data from the cache to make room for new data.
   - Typically guided by a cache eviction policy (e.g., Least Recently Used, First In First Out).

5. **Cache Staleness**:
   - Occurs when the data in the cache is outdated compared to the original source.

Caching is a powerful optimization technique that improves application performance by reducing latency and offloading requests to the original data source. Proper implementation and management of caching strategies are critical for ensuring efficiency and data accuracy.
