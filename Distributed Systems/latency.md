# Latency and Performance 
Latency and performance are critical aspects of distributed systems, as they directly impact the user experience and the system's ability to handle large amounts of data and traffic. In distributed systems, optimizing latency and performance involves considering factors such as data locality, load balancing, and caching strategies. Here's an overview of these aspects of latency and performance:

## A. Data Locality
Data locality refers to the organization and distribution of data within a distributed system to minimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred between nodes
