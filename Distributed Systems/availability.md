# Availbility
Availability is a measure of how accessible and reliable a system is to its users. In distributed systems, high availability is crucial to ensure that the system remains operational even in the face of failures or increased demand. It is the backbone that enables businesses to provide uninterrupted services to their users, regardless of any unforeseen circumstances. In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, where downtime can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage, high availability has become a critical requirement for organizations across various industries.
