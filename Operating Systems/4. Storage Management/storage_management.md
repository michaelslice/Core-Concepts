# **Storage Management**  
Storage management involves organizing and managing various types of storage devices to ensure data reliability, performance, and efficient access.

## **Storage Hierarchy and Devices**  

1. **Primary Storage**  
   - **Registers and Cache**: Extremely fast and close to the CPU.  
   - **RAM**: Main memory for active processes.  

2. **Secondary Storage**  
   - **Solid State Drive (SSDs)**: Fast, durable, and use flash memory.  
   - **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**: Slower, less expensive, and use magnetic storage.  

3. **Tertiary Storage**  
   - Devices like optical disks (CD/DVD) and magnetic tapes.  
   - Used for archival and backup storage.

## **SSDs, HDDs, and RAID**  

1. **SSDs (Solid State Drive)**  
   - Use NAND flash memory.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Faster read/write speeds.  
     - Low power consumption and no moving parts.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - Higher cost per GB compared to HDDs.  
     - Limited write cycles.  

2. **HDDs (Hard Disk Drive)**  
   - Use spinning disks and read/write heads.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Lower cost per GB.  
     - Large storage capacities.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - Slower speeds and mechanical wear.

## **Storage Access Times**  

1. **Access Time Components**:  
   - **Seek Time**: Time to position the read/write head (HDD-specific).  
   - **Rotational Latency**: Time waiting for the disk to rotate to the correct sector.  
   - **Transfer Time**: Time to read/write data after positioning.  

2. **Comparisons**:  
   - SSDs have minimal seek time and no rotational latency.  
   - HDDs have higher seek times and rotational latencies due to mechanical parts.

## **Disk Management**  

Disk management encompasses operations like partitioning, formatting, and ensuring efficient storage utilization.  

1. **Partitioning**:  
   - Divides a physical disk into logical sections (partitions).  
   - Each partition can act as a separate storage unit.  
   - **Types**:  
     - **Primary Partition**: Bootable sections.  
     - **Extended Partition**: Allows more logical partitions.  

2. **Formatting**:  
   - Prepares a partition for data storage by creating a file system.

## **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**  

Disk scheduling optimizes the order of requests to reduce seek time and improve efficiency. Common algorithms include:  

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**:  
   - Processes requests in the order they arrive.  
   - Simple but may cause inefficiency if requests are far apart.  

2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**:  
   - Processes the closest request first.  
   - Reduces seek time but may cause starvation for distant requests.  

3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**:  
   - Moves the head in one direction, serving all requests, then reverses direction.  
   - Provides better fairness and reduces seek time.  

4. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**:  
   - Similar to SCAN, but the head only moves in one direction and returns to the start without servicing requests on the way back.  
   - Ensures uniform wait times.  

5. **LOOK and C-LOOK**:  
   - Variants of SCAN and C-SCAN.  
   - The head stops at the last request in each direction, reducing unnecessary movement.
