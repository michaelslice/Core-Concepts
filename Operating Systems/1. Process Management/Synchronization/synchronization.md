## **Synchronization**
**Synchronization** ensures the orderly execution of processes or threads in a multi-tasking environment, particularly when they share resources or data. It avoids race conditions, inconsistencies, and other issues in concurrent environments.

## **Critical Section Problem**
The **Critical Section Problem** arises when multiple processes or threads access a shared resource. It ensures that:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can enter the critical section at a time.
2. **Progress**: If no process is in its critical section, the selection of the next process to enter the critical section cannot be postponed indefinitely.
3. **Bounded Waiting**: A process should not wait indefinitely to enter its critical section.

**Example**: When two processes update a shared counter,  
Without synchronization, both processes might overwrite each other's updates, leading to an incorrect result.

## **Synchronization Mechanisms**

1. **Locks**  
   - A simple mechanism to enforce mutual exclusion.
   - A process acquires a lock before entering the critical section and releases it upon exiting.
   - **Drawback**: Can lead to busy-waiting (spinning while waiting for a lock).

2. **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Object)**  
   - A binary lock that ensures only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.
   - Typically includes blocking behavior: a thread trying to acquire an unavailable mutex waits (without spinning).

3. **Semaphores**  
   - A general synchronization primitive.
   - **Binary Semaphore**: Works like a mutex (0 or 1).
   - **Counting Semaphore**: Allows a specific number of threads to access a resource.

**Operations on Semaphores**:
- **wait()**: Decrements the semaphore value. If the value is negative, the process is blocked.
- **signal()**: Increments the semaphore value and unblocks waiting processes.

## **Deadlock**

**Deadlock** occurs when a set of processes is waiting for each other indefinitely due to a circular dependency on resources.  
**Necessary Conditions for Deadlock**:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource is held in a non-shareable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait**: Processes holding resources can request additional ones.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of processes forms a circular chain, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

## **Deadlock Detection and Avoidance**

1. **Deadlock Detection**:
   - Detect cycles in the resource allocation graph.
   - Use algorithms like the **Banker's Algorithm** to check if the current resource allocation leads to a safe state.

2. **Deadlock Avoidance**:
   - Dynamically allocate resources to prevent deadlocks.
   - Requires knowledge of the maximum resource requirements for each proc
