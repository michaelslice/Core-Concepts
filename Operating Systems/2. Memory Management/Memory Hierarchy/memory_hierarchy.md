# **Memory Hierarchy**  
The memory hierarchy organizes memory based on speed, size, and cost. From fastest to slowest:

1. **Registers**: Fastest, smallest, and closest to the CPU.  
2. **Cache**: Stores frequently used data for faster access.  
3. **Main Memory (RAM)**: Stores active programs and data.  
4. **Secondary Storage (Disk, SSD)**: Non-volatile storage for files and data.  
5. **Tertiary Storage**: Long-term storage (e.g., tapes and other storage media).
