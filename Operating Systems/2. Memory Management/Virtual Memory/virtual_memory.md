## **Virtual Memory**  
A memory management technique that creates the illusion of a larger memory space than physically available.

## **Allows More Programs to Run**  
1. **Physical RAM** is limited.  
2. Virtual memory uses a portion of the **hard drive** or **SSD** as an extension of RAM, called the **page file** or **swap space**.  
3. When RAM is full, less-used data is moved to virtual memory, thus freeing up physical RAM for active programs.

## **Key Concepts of Virtual Memory**  

1. **Logical Address Space vs. Physical Address Space**  
    - **Logical Address Space**: The set of addresses generated by a program (virtual address).  
    - **Physical Address Space**: The set of addresses corresponding to locations in physical RAM. Virtual memory maps logical addresses to physical addresses using a mechanism called **paging or segmentation**.  

2. **Address Translation**  
    - Address translation is handled by the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**, a hardware component. It maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.  

3. **Backing Store (Disk)**  
    - When RAM is full, the operating system uses a portion of the hard drive (or SSD) as an extension of RAM. This area is called the **swap space** or **page file**.

## **Advantages of Virtual Memory**  

1. **Program Size Exceeds Physical Memory**  
    - Programs can run even if their size exceeds the available RAM.  

2. **Memory Isolation**  
    - Each process runs in its virtual address space, ensuring one process cannot access or modify another's memory.  

3. **Efficient Memory Utilization**  
    - Only the portion of a program that is actively used (working set) needs to be in physical memory.  

4. **Simplified Programming Model**  
    - Programmers can write code assuming the program has a contiguous block of memory.

## **Key Mechanisms of Virtual Memory**  

1. **Paging**  
    - Memory is divided into fixed-sized blocks called **pages** (in virtual memory) and **frames** (in physical memory).  
    - Pages are loaded into frames on demand.  
    - A **Page Table** is used to map virtual pages to physical frames.  

2. **Segmentation**  
    - Memory is divided into variable-sized segments, each representing a logical unit (e.g., code, data, stack).  
    - A **segment table** maps segments to physical memory.  

3. **Demand Paging**  
    - Pages are not loaded into memory until they are accessed.  
    - When a program accesses a page not in memory, a **page fault** occurs. The operating system loads the required page from disk.

## **Performance Considerations**  

1. **Page Faults**  
    - Occur when a requested page is not in memory.  
    - Handling a page fault involves reading data from disk, which is much slower than accessing RAM.  

2. **Thrashing**  
    - Happens when the system spends more time handling page faults than executing actual processes.  
    - It occurs when the working set of processes exceeds the available physical memory.  

3. **Replacement Policies**  
    - When a page fault occurs and memory is full, the OS must decide which page to evict. Common algorithms include:  
        - **Least Recently Used (LRU)**  
        - **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**  
        - **Optimal Page Replacement** (theoretical)
