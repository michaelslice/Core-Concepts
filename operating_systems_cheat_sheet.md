**Operating System Cheat Sheet**

# **1. Process Management**

**Process**: Is an instance of a program in execution 
**Thread**: Is a smaller, lightweight unit of execution within a process. A single process can have multiple threads

**Inter-Process Communication(IPC)**: Is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions

**Process Control Block(PCB)**: Is a data structure used by a computer operating system to store all the information about a process

**Synchronization** ensures the orderly execution of processes or threads in a multi-tasking environment, particularly when they share resources or data. It avoids race conditions, inconsistencies, and other issues in concurrent environments.

## **CPU Task Scheduling**
1. **First Come First Serve**: The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first 
2. **Shorted Job First**: The process with the smallest execution time to execute next
3. **Longest Job First**: The opposite of shortest job first
4. **Priority Scheduling**: The most important process must be done first

## **Synchronization Mechanisms**

**Locks**: Broader term representing any mechanism used to control access to a shared resource in a concurrent environment
**Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Object)**: A specific type of lock that ensures mutual exclusion: only one thread can access the critical section at a time 
**Semaphores**: Is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multi-tasking operating system

# 2. Memory Management

When a process is running, it has its own virtual address

**Logical Address**: Generated by the CPU 
**Physical Address**: Actual location in memory
**Virtual Address**: It is not a physical address on the actual hardware but rather an address in a virtual address space  
**Virtual Address Space**: Is the set of ranges of virtual addresses available for a process 

***

Each process has its own page table

**Page**: Is a Fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, when a program is executed its virtual address space is divided into pages
**Paging**: Is a memory mangagement scheme which a comuter stores and retrieves data from Disk for use in RAM

**Frame**: Is a fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory (RAM)
- Frames are the actual storage locations in physical memory where data is stored 

**Segmentation**: Is a OS memory management technique of dividing a computer's primary memory into segments or sections, for each process
- Segments are swapped between disc and RAM as needed

**Page Table**: Is a data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer to store mappings between virtual addresses and physical addresses
- Maps **Virtual Addresses** to **Physical Addresses**
- Translation layer that connects Virtual Pages to Physical Frames
- When a program accesses a memory address, the OS translates the virtual address to a physical address using this **page table**

**Page Fault**: If a Page is Not in Memory 
- The operating system will load the required page from DISK into physical memory
- Updates the page table with new mapping 

**Summary**: The use of pages and frames allows for efficient memory usage, as it allows the system to handle larger programs and multi tasking efficiently

***

**Memory Management Unit(MMU)**: Is a hardware unit that examines all memory references on the memory bus, translating these requests from 

**Fragmentation**: Refers to inefficient utilization of memory due to how memory is allocated and managed
- Occurs when memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks

**Why Use Virtual RAM?**: The purpose of virtual RAM is to prevent the computer from crashing if it runs out of physical RAM.

**Translation Lookaside Buffer**: Is a memory cache that stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory.
- Used to reduce the time it takes to access a user memory location
- It is part of the Memory-Management Unit(MMU)
- A TLB may reside between the CPU and the CPU cache

## What is Faster Accessing Data on RAM or Disk?
- RAM is designed for fast read and write operations. It is directly integrated with the CPU, allowing data to be accessed in a matter of nanoseconds.
- Disk (HDD/SSD), on the other hand, is much slower. Hard disk drives (HDDs) involve mechanical parts (like spinning platters and moving read/write heads), which adds latency. Solid-state drives (SSDs) are faster than HDDs but still have higher latency compared to RAM.

## Overall Summary for Virtual Address to Physical Address

1. A process is running, and it is allocated its own virtual address space
2. The Memory Management Unit (MMU), with the help of the operating system, manages the conversion from virtual addresses to physical addresses using a page table, which maps virtual addresses to physical locations in RAM (and potentially on disk, in case of page faults).
3. The Translation Lookaside Buffer, is a cache used the Memory Mangement Unit to provide quick lookups for address translations instead of accessing the page table everytime
    - TLB Hit: If the translation is found in the TLB, the physical address is immediately provided, and the access is fast.
    - TLB Miss: If the translation is not found, the MMU must look it up in the page table (which may involve slower memory access), and then the translation is added to the TLB for future use.
