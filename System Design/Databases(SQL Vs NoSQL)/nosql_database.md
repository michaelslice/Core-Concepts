# NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases, also known as "Not Only SQL" databases, are a diverse group of non-relational databases designed to address the limitations of traditional SQL databases, particularly in terms of scalability, flexibility, and performance under specific workloads. NoSQL databases do not adhere to the relational model and typically do not use SQL as their primary query language. Instead, they employ various data models and query languages, depending on the specific type of NoSQL database being used.
