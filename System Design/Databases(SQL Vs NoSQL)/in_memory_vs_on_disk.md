# In-Memory Database vs. On-Disk Database
In-memory databases and on-disk databases are two types of database systems designed for storing and managing data, but they fundamentally differ in how and where they store their data. Understanding these differences is key to choosing the right type of database for a specific application or workload.
## In-Memory Database (IMDB)
### Storage Mechanism:
- **Data Storage**: Primarily stores data in the main memory (RAM) of the server.
- **Persistence**: Some in-memory databases can persist data on disk, but the primary data access and manipulation happen in memory.
