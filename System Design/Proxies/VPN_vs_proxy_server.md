# VPN vs. Proxy Server
VPN (Virtual Private Network) and Proxy Servers are both tools used for privacy and security online, but they function differently and serve distinct purposes. Understanding their differences is essential in determining which one to use based on your needs.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- **Definition**: A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server operated by the VPN service. All your internet traffic is routed through this tunnel, meaning that your data is secure from external observation.
