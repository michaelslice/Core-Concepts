- In this part include all the technologies used, and some brief info on their functionality, and why we are using them
### Detailed Design
- Same as the previous information but more in depth analsis of how a user will interact with our technolgies
### Limitations and Future Work
- List any potential problems, or flaws in the current design
### References 
- Include information on any sources used in creating your design doc
