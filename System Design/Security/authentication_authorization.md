# What is Authentication?
- Authentication in software systems is like showing your ID at the entrance of a club. It's the process of verifying who you are. Here's how it works in the digital world:
- Basics: Just like the bouncer checks your ID, authentication in software checks if you are who you say you are. This is usually done through something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone or security token), or something you are (like your fingerprint).
# What is Authorization?
- Authorization in software systems is like getting a specific wristband at a festival that allows you access to certain areas. It's about granting or denying permissions to do something after your identity is verified.

- After Authentication: Authorization always comes after authentication. First, the system recognizes you (like the club knows who you are), and then it decides what you are allowed to do (like what areas of the club you can enter).
