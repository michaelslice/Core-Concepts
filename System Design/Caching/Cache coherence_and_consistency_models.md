# Cache Coherence and Consistency Models
Cache coherence and consistency models are essential concepts in the context of caching, particularly in distributed systems or multi-core processors. These models ensure that data remains accurate and up-to-date across multiple caches or processing units.
## Cache Coherence
Cache coherence is a property of multi-core processors or distributed systems that ensures all processors or nodes see the same view of shared data. In a system with multiple caches, each cache may store a local copy of the shared data
