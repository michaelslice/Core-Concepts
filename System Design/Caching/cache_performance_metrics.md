# Cache Performance Metrics
When implementing caching, itâ€™s important to measure the performance of the cache to ensure that it is effective in reducing latency and improving system performance. Here are some of the most common cache performance metrics:
## Hit rate
The hit rate is the percentage of requests that are served by the cache without accessing the original source. A high hit rate indicates that the cache is effective in reducing the number of requests to the original source, while a low hit rate indicates that the cache may not be providing significant performance benefits.
